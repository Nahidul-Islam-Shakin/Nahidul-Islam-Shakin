## 💡 About Me

I’m Shakin, a passionate Flutter developer with **around 5 years of experience** in building mobile apps. I started learning Flutter about 5 years ago, and since then, it’s been a crazy ride of learning, building, and growing. 

Currently, I work as a **Software Engineer (Mobile Apps)** at Artificial Soft. I love building high-performance, scalable, and pixel-perfect mobile applications. I follow **Clean Architecture**, **MVVM architecture**, and clean code practices to ensure everything remains maintainable and developer-friendly.

From internship to leading a team — my journey taught me not just how to code, but how to solve problems, debug like a detective, and lead teams with confidence.
